# FQ-HLL Autocorrection Algorithm Description

Feel free to read the PDF here titled `description.pdf`, which was compiled with `description.tex`.

In this PDF, blue boxes are titles, purple boxes are subtitles, and pink boxes contain the most important information. If you want to roughly skim this description, I suggest only reading the pink boxes. However, reading it in its entirety would allow for a more cohesive understanding of the material.
